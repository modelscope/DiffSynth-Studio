## Introduction

DiffSynth Studio is a Diffusion engine. We have restructured architectures including Text Encoder, UNet, VAE, among others, maintaining compatibility with models from the open-source community while enhancing computational performance. We provide many interesting features. Enjoy the magic of Diffusion models!

Until now, DiffSynth Studio has supported the following models:

* [CogVideo](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b)
* [FLUX](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)
* [ExVideo](https://huggingface.co/ECNU-CILab/ExVideo-SVD-128f-v1)

### Video Synthesis

#### Text-to-video using CogVideoX-5B

CogVideoX-5B is released by ZhiPu. We provide an improved pipeline, supporting text-to-video, video editing, self-upscaling and video interpolation. [`examples/video_synthesis`](./examples/video_synthesis/)

The video on the left is generated using the original text-to-video pipeline, while the video on the right is the result after editing and frame interpolation.
