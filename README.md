# DiffSynth Studio


## Introduction

DiffSynth Studio is a Diffusion engine. We have restructured architectures including Text Encoder, UNet, VAE, among others, maintaining compatibility with models from the open-source community while enhancing computational performance. We provide many interesting features. Enjoy the magic of Diffusion models!

Until now, DiffSynth Studio has supported the following models:

* [ExVideo](https://huggingface.co/ECNU-CILab/ExVideo-SVD-128f-v1)
* [Kolors](https://huggingface.co/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors)
* [Stable Diffusion 3](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium)

## News


- **June 21, 2024.** ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ We propose ExVideo, a post-tuning technique aimed at enhancing the capability of video generation models. We have extended Stable Video Diffusion to achieve the generation of long videos up to 128 frames.

## Usage (in Python code)

The Python examples are in [`examples`](./examples/). We provide an overview here.

### Long Video Synthesis

We trained an extended video synthesis model, which can generate 128 frames. [`examples/ExVideo`](./examples/ExVideo/)
