# CogVideoX

### Example: Text-to-Video using CogVideoX-5B (Experimental)

See [cogvideo_text_to_video.py](cogvideo_text_to_video.py).

First, we generate a video using prompt "an astronaut riding a horse on Mars".

Then, we convert the astronaut to a robot.

Upscale the video using the model itself.

Make the video look smoother by interpolating frames.

Then, we add a blue collar to the dog.
