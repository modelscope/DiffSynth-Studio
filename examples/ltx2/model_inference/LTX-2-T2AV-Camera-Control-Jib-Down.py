    "During the descent, the following elements become visible near the bottom of the frame: "
    "- The polished concrete floor with subtle reflections of the girl’s shoes, "
    "- A small branded mat labeled “Diffsynth-Studio” placed just beneath her feet, "
    "- The lower part of a sleek workstation desk with a glowing logo on its front panel, partially hidden at the start but fully revealed as the camera lowers. "
